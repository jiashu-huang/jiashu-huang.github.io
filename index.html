    <h1>Lecture notes</h1>
    <p>I spent the 2023‚Äì24 academic year as an exchange student at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where I took the Maths Part II Tripos and also did one module in Physics Part II. As per the glorious tradition among Cantab Mathmos, I posit my lecture notes here. May God have mercy upon your soul.</p>
